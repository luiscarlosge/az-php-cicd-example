# Faculty Images

This directory contains faculty member photos for the website.

## Placeholder Image

- **File**: `placeholder.svg`
- **Dimensions**: 300x300px
- **Format**: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- **Purpose**: Temporary placeholder for faculty member photo
- **Usage**: Should be replaced with actual faculty photo when available

## Alt Text Support

Alt text for faculty images is provided through the translation system:
- Spanish: `t('faculty.image_alt')` - "Foto de Luis Carlos Galvis Espitia"
- English: `t('faculty.image_alt')` - "Photo of Luis Carlos Galvis Espitia"

## Implementation Notes

The placeholder image displays:
- A neutral gray background (#f3f2f1)
- A simple person icon silhouette (#d2d0ce)
- "Faculty Photo" text label

This ensures accessibility and provides a professional appearance until the actual photo is available.
